## END-TO-END PROJECTStudent Performance Predictor
# raghava
This is a web-based application built using Streamlit that allows users to predict the average score of a student based on various features. The prediction is made using a machine learning model trained on a dataset containing students' scores in math, reading, and writing. The user inputs certain features, and the model outputs the predicted average score.

# Overview

The goal of this app is to provide a platform where users can input certain features about a student, and the app will predict their average score based on a pre-trained machine learning model.

# Features

1. User Input: Users will provide input data such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, and whether the student has completed a test preparation course.
2. Model Prediction: Based on the user input, the app will use the pre-trained machine learning model to predict the student's average score across three subjects: math, reading, and writing.
3. Data Preprocessing: The app will automatically handle any necessary data preprocessing (e.g., converting categorical values into numerical format) before feeding the input to the model.

# Technologies Used

The following technologies are used in the development of the app:

- Streamlit: A Python library used to create the interactive web app.
- Scikit-learn: A machine learning library used to train and apply the model.
- Pandas: A Python library used for data handling and preprocessing.
- Pickle: A Python module used to save and load the trained model.
- Python 3.6+: Programming language used for development.

# How the App Works

1. User Input:

Once the app is launched, the user will be presented with several options for input:

- Gender: Select either "male" or "female".
- Race/Ethnicity: Select one of the five groups: "group A", "group B", "group C", "group D", or "group E".
- Parental Level of Education: Select from the following levels:
  - "high school"
  - "some college"
  - "associate's degree"
  - "bachelor's degree"
  - "master's degree"
- Lunch Type: Select either "standard" or "free/reduced".
- Test Preparation Course: Select either "none" or "completed".

2. Data Processing:

The input data is then preprocessed:

- Categorical Data Encoding: The categorical features such as gender, race/ethnicity, etc., are transformed into numeric format using one-hot encoding. This is required for feeding the data into the machine learning model.

3. Model Prediction:

- Machine Learning Model: The app uses a Linear Regression model trained on a dataset that contains students' scores in three subjects (math, reading, and writing).
- Prediction Output: After processing the input data, the app predicts the student's average score and displays it to the user.
